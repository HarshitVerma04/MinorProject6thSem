# MinorProject6thSem

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation and experimental workflow for our **6th Semester Minor Project**.
The project includes model development, experimentation through Jupyter notebooks, supporting scripts, and the results generated during the experiments.

Phase 1: It contains the baseline experiments where models are trained and evaluated on clean rgb images without compression.

Phase 2: It contains the experiments where models are trained after applying highpass filter and then evaluated.

Robustness Testing: This consists of robustness evaluation under distribution shift caused by JPEG compression.

# Main Code for Experiments

The **core implementation used to generate the results reported in the project** is located in the following directories:

### Experiment Notebooks

All primary experiments and model implementations are located in:

```
notebooks/
```

These notebooks are separated for Phase 1 and Phase 2 and include:

* Data preprocessing
* Model implementation
* Training pipeline
* Evaluation of results
* Visualization of outputs

---

### Supporting Scripts

Additional scripts used for various tasks in the workflow are located in:
```
scripts/
```

These scripts include utilities for dataset preparation

---

### Results

Outputs produced by running the experiments are stored in:

```
results/
```

This folder includes the following for Phase 1 and Phase 2:

* model outputs and evaluation metrics
* generated AUC curve plots
